Rock Paper Scissors

Understanding the problem:
Give the previously created javascript console game of rock, paper, scissors a simple UI

Planning:
-Go back to your “Rock Paper Scissors” game from a previous lesson and give it a simple UI so that the player can play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt.
-Copy your original code into a new file so you don’t lose it.
-For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
-Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that calls your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
-Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
-Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
-You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of the programmer’s life.
-Don’t forget to go back and add your new version to the original Rock Paper Scissors Project!


Pseudo Code:
-Create a simple UI
    -Create 3 buttons
    -Create a score board
        -Player Score
        -Computer Score
        -Text box 
-Instead of pushing text into the console. Show scores and information in the website.
    -Count who wins 
    -Display text for each round
-Event listner for each click
-Return event to number and string
-Place numbers in scoreboard
-Place string in box
    -event clicks change css to display information
  

Outcome:
